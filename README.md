# dotfiles

For when I need to set up a new machine.
Eternal WIP.

## How, what?

- Download and unzip this repository, preferably directly in `~`.

- Inside it run `$ ./scripts/1-setup.sh` to install a lot of stuff.

- Close and open a new shell, it will now run zsh!

- Back in the dotfiles folder, run `$ ./scripts/2-copy.sh` to copy over config files.

- Install `./assets/hackfont` via your font manager.

Yay!
