For when I need to set up a new machine.
Eternal WIP.

## How, what?

- Download and unzip this repository

- `cd` into it and run `$ ./setup/00.sh` to update packages and install a lot of stuff

- Run `$ ./setup/01.sh` to configure git, generate a ssh key, install zsh and clone emacs.d

- Run `$ ./setup/02.sh` to copy the zsh theme and zshrc into their corresponding places

- Logout and in and voila!

- Install `./assets/hackfont` via your font manager.

Yay!
